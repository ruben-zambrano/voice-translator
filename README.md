# voice-translator

Training project based in [Mouredev](https://gist.github.com/mouredev/0ea42112751f0187d90d5403d1f333e2) example.

The project use two different APIs to get you audio translated in the language you want.
This example it's configured to save your audio in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and return it in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

The project use different APIs / libraries:

- [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) which we use locally and not calling directly their API in the cloud (free). We use Whisper to transcribe the audio into text.
- [Translate](https://pypi.org/project/translate/) python library to translate text in different languages
- [elevenlabs.io](elevenlabs.io) allow us create audio in different languages based in text
